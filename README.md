# Combine Cycle Power Plant

* This is a project I did as a project in class, where I built a model to predict the net hourly energy output (EP) for a combined cycle power plant.
* The quantity EP depends on several parameters including including hourly average ambient variables Temperature (T), Ambient Pressure (AP), Relative Humidity (RH) and Exhaust Vacuum (V).
* Data set can be downloaded on [UCI Repository](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Combined+Cycle+Power+Plant).
* Linear Regression models were developed and plotted with different combinations of the input variables.
* The models were first considered without normlizing the data and also considered with normalized data.
* Optimal models were identified from the 2 sets.
* The model accuracy were evaluated using Root Mean Squared Error (RSME) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE).
* Coefficient of determination was also evaluated to see how much variation in the data is predicted by the linear model.
* The project writeup was published on my [Medium](https://medium.com/@kyadeleke1/linear-regression-with-python-dc73c4479ae9) page.
